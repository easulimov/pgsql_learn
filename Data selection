### Select all data from table
SELECT *
FROM products;

### Select individual data from table
SELECT product_id, product_name, unit_price
FROM products;

### Select individual data and multiply it
SELECT product_id, product_name, unit_price * units_in_stock
FROM products;

### Select without dublicates
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM employees;

SELECT DISTINCT city, country
FROM employees;


### Get count of all rows (does not count records with NULL values)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM orders;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
FROM employees;

### Select with WHERE (filtering)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA';

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM products
WHERE unit_price > 20;

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '1998-04-08';

SELECT customer_id, company_name, contact_name, city, country, phone
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' AND region = 'WA';

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Berlin' OR city = 'London' OR city = 'San Francisco';

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE shipped_date > '1998-04-30' AND (freight < 75 OR freight > 150)

### Select data in an interval (BETWEEN)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE freight BETWEEN 20 AND 40


### Select data from the list (is equivalent to using many OR)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country IN ('Mexico', 'USA', 'UK')

### Select everything except what is in the list
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country NOT IN ('Mexico', 'USA', 'UK')

### Select sorted data (ORDER BY ascending & descending)
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM customers
ORDER BY country ASC

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM customers
ORDER BY country DESC

SELECT DISTINCT country, city
FROM customers
ORDER BY country ASC, city ASC

### Calculating the minimum, maximum, average and summarize (MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM )
SELECT ship_city, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE ship_city = 'London'
ORDER BY order_date ASC

#or
SELECT MIN (order_date)
FROM orders
WHERE ship_city = 'London'

SELECT ship_city, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE ship_city = 'London'
ORDER BY order_date DESC

#or
SELECT MAX (order_date)
FROM orders
WHERE ship_city = 'London'

SELECT AVG (unit_price)
FROM products
WHERE discontinued <> 1

SELECT SUM (units_in_stock)
FROM products
WHERE discontinued <> 1

### Pattern matching (LIKE)
### Placeholder '%' - 0, 1 or more of any characters
### '_' - is equal to any one character
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE '%et'

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE last_name LIKE '_a%'


### Output limitation (LIMIT, used at the end of the construction of others)
SELECT product_name, unit_price
FROM products
WHERE discontinued <> 1
ORDER BY unit_price DESC
LIMIT 10

### Data grouping (GROUP BY)
SELECT ship_country, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE freight > 50
GROUP BY ship_country
ORDER BY count DESC

SELECT category_id, SUM(units_in_stock)
FROM products
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY SUM(units_in_stock) DESC
LIMIT 5
